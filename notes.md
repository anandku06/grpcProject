# gRPC + GO

## gRPC
- Google Remote Procedure Call
- a powerful open-source tool made by Google.
- helps different applications or services talk to each other - fast, securely, and in any language.
- allows a client application to directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object
- achieved through a contact-first approach, where the service interface  and the structure of the payload messages are defined in a `.proto` file using **Protocol Buffers**.
